Description: Eventlet is a concurrent networking library for Python
 Eventlet is a concurrent networking library for Python that allows you
 to change how you run your code, not how you write it.
 It uses epoll or libevent for highly scalable non-blocking I/O.
 Coroutines ensure that the developer uses a blocking style of
 programming that is similar to threading, but provide the benefits of
 non-blocking I/O.  The event dispatch is implicit, which means you can
 easily use Eventlet from the Python interpreter, or as a small part of
 a larger application.  It's easy to get started using Eventlet, and
 easy to convert existing applications to use it. Start off by looking
 at examples, common design patterns, and the list of the basic API
 primitives.
